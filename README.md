# React Boilerplate with Typescript, Redux, Redux-loop, Jest, Firebase, cypress.io and poi.js

A bare minimum react-poi-typescript boilerplate with example of unit test and acceptance test (e2e via cypress.io).
It runns [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) on all changed typescript files in commit.
Moreover it also runs [tslint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) and unit and acceptance tests before it allows you to do `git push`.
